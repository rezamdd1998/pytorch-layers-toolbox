# pytorch-layers-toolbox

I've  written some codes to modify some layers and thus train the models better. (**This repository will be updated!**)



properties:
#### - weight initialization of the layers. (Xaviar and He initialization)
#### - integrate the batch normalization and dropout with convLayers
